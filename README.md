GitHub Repository for work done for Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: 2025

### OVERVIEW 
In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### CRISP-DM Framework
To frame the task, throughout our practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.  This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

### Business Understanding
From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.
